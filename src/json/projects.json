        "description": "A full-stack web application similar to Naviance that assists upcoming undergraduate students on their college planning by recommending them colleges and universities based on their profiles, grades, and test scores. This was developed primarily using React and jQuery for front-end design and MySQL and Java Servlets for back-end design. This application served as the final group project for the Software Engineering course over the Spring 2020 semester, where I was responsible for creating a majority of the front-end and UI/UX design. (Note: The current URL for this project only serves to display the front-end interface, and does not include any back-end communication)",
